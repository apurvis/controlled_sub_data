Controlled Sub Data
================

A basic CRUD application to help the Immigrant Defense Project collate information on discrepancies between state and federal controlled substance statutes.

Naming Conventions
------------------
A statute's string identifier is created by concatenating its state (or federal) and its effective date.

String identifiers for amendments to statutes are identified by the statute identifier plus "Amended <DATE>".

On spelling discrepancies
-------------------------
If there are spelling discrepancies for a substance name between different statutes, you should create two different statutes.


Ruby on Rails

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.2.2
